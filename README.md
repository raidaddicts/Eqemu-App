# Eqemu App  -- The Brain Child of Mortenson of Raid Addicts

Hey Folks

So at one point I had a player who I was working with to create an eqemu app, but they vanished but we were able to get this far with it which is a Magelo Clone 

What I would like to see happen with the app is the following:

Phase 1:
* Main Splash screen with buttons or drop downs which provide all areas of the app.
* Functional Magelo Clone
* Player Rankings section of the app based on HP / AC / Mana / Endurance or whatever filter the player sets.
* Functional Allakhazam Clone
* Who is online button showing active players on the server utilizing telnet or other means.
* Discord Connectivity through the app maybe? Not sure that is possible.

Phase 2:
Player can create an account with the app and then attach their current player(s) to the app which would allow several things:

* Events setup by the server op which would send a push notification or popup that would inform the person when they leveled up or looted an item giving hints on what content to do next.
* Items setup by the server op such as Alternate Currency and Tradeable or No Trade items which could be used in a section of the app that would mimic the bazaar except would work when the players were not online.
* Some kind of a Return Home button for stuck players.
* Petition System



More ideas by other folks would be great to add to this list.

Morty
